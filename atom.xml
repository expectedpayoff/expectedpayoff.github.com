    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sun/Oracle Java was <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/67909/how-do-i-install-oracle-jdk-6">removed from Linux distros</a> in 2011 due to licensing issues.<br/>
It can only be downloaded directly from Oracle&#8217;s website now and installed manually.
There are many different ways of doing that, but for Debian and Debian-derivatives,
I prefer using Debian&#8217;s excellent <code>update-alternatives</code> tool.  Here&#8217;s how and why:</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/byrongibson/scripts/tree/master/install/haskell#readme">How To</a></h4>

<ol>
<li>Download the package, extract or build to <code>/usr/lib/jvm/[version]</code>,
<code>/opt/java/[version]</code>, <code>/opt/scala/[version]</code>, <code>/opt/haskell/[version]</code>,
or anywhere else in the system file system (except <code>~/</code>).</li>
<li>Change owner to root:root with <code>sudo chown -Rv root:root /opt/java/[version]</code>.</li>
<li>Run the <code>update-alternatives</code> script (<a href="https://github.com/byrongibson/scripts/tree/master/install/java">Java</a>, <a href="https://github.com/byrongibson/scripts/tree/master/install/scala">Scala</a>, <a href="https://github.com/byrongibson/scripts/tree/master/install/haskell">Haskell</a>). Feel
free to fork and modify for other languages.</li>
</ol>


<p>See my installation guide for <a href="https://github.com/byrongibson/scripts/tree/master/install/haskell#readme">Haskell</a> for more details. The same process works
for any package.  The tricky part is writing the <code>update-alternatives</code> script, but it
should be clear how it works upon closer inspection of those scripts.</p>

<p>The <code>update-alternatives</code> commands take the form:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Install  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>4</span>

 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Read on for why&#8230;</p>

<!-- more -->


<h4><a href="https://github.com/byrongibson/scripts/tree/master/install/haskell#readme">Why?</a></h4>

<ol>
<li><p>It can be used with any package, not just Java.  I currently use it to manage
multiple versions of Java, Scala, Haskell GHC, Haskell Platform, Ant, and Maven.</p></li>
<li><p>Debian repos are known for providing stable software, but sometimes at the cost of
being up to date.  Great for production machines, not so great when you want to
experiment with the latest and greatest on your dev box.  <code>update-alternatives</code>
solves that, by letting you easily bypass the repos to manually add current versions
of software to the system (linking them into /usr/bin/, /usr/lib, /usr/share, etc.)
without conflicting with the version from the repos.  With <code>update-alternatives</code> you
can install both, and toggle among the active one depending on what you&#8217;re working on.</p></li>
<li><p>Upgrade to a new version without deleting the old.  Both can co-exist on the system
at the same time, unlike installing the software via repo.  If the new version breaks
something that depends on it, easily rollback to the prior version with just a
<code>sudo update-alternatives --config</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep your system cleaner by putting software in a single location like
/opt/java/jdk/1.6.0_34 and soft linking it to system directories like /usr/bin,
/usr/lib, /usr/share, etc.  A typical *nix install is messy - files are deposited
throughout the system in /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /usr/share, etc.  <code>update-alternatives</code>
solves that problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Easily uninstall any package.  For example, switch the current active package to
another version with <code>update-alternatives --config java</code> and delete the unwanted one
with <code>rm -rf /opt/java/jdk/1.7.0_04</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the software via System PATH instead of user PATH.  <code>update-alternatives</code>
automatically installs software to the system path it is designed for, usually
/usr/bin.</p></li>
</ol>


<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>

<p>This system reminds me a bit of <a href="http://www.gobolinux.org/">Gobo Linux</a>, which seeks to [redesign the Linux
filesystem][7] by putting full package distributions in a single location, like
<code>/Programs/Bash/3.0</code>.  A great idea that would make Linux much more user-friendly.
<code>update-alternatives</code> is one small step in that direction.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://nancysherman.com/">Nancy Sherman</a> was the first Distinguished Chair in Ethics at the U.S. Naval Academy andis currently University Professor of Philosophy at Georgetown. <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/a-crack-in-the-stoic-armor/?src=me&amp;amp;ref=homepage%22">Her article</a> in the NY Times today discusses the subtle, complex, confusing costs to civilized people tasked to fight our modern wars.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the military, even those who have never laid eyes on a page of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus">Epictetus</a>, still live as if they have. To suck it up is to move beyond grieving and keep fighting; it is to stare death down in a death-saturated place; it is to face one more deployment after two or three or four already. It is hard to imagine a popular philosophy better suited to deprivation and constant subjection to stressors [than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoicism</a>].</p>

<p>And yet in the more than 30 interviews I conducted with soldiers who have returned from the long current wars, what I heard was the wish to let go of the Stoic armor. They wanted to feel and process the loss. They wanted to register the complex inner moral landscape of war by finding some measure of empathy with their own emotions.&#8221;</p>

    <id>http://expectedpayoff.github.com/blog/2012/06/07/humanitys-greatest-danger-our-inability-to-understand-the-exponential-function</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-QA2rkpBSY">Excellent video lecture</a> from University of Colorado professor Albert Bartlett on the exponential growth function and its real world implications. This should be taught and retaught every year of elementary school through undergraduate education.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, exponential growth occurs anytime an amount increases by n% per t time period. Finance and economics are obvious culprits: 2% inflation per year, 3% economic grown per year, 2% interest on bonds, 20% interest on credit card debt, etc.</p>

<p>The crux of the lecture is that it is easy to calculate the rate at which an amount with constant growth will double: Simply divide 70 by the absolute percent.</p>

<p>For example, GDP growth is 3% per year, how soon till the GDP doubles? 70/3 = 23.3, so 23.3 years until the GDP doubles.</p>

<p>Say population growth is 7% per year, how soon till the population doubles? 70/7 = 10 years.</p>

<p>Say your credit card interest rate is 20%, how soon till the amount you owe doubles? 70/20 = 3.5 years.</p>

<p>This little rule of thumb is immensely useful for interpreting news reports, government proclamations, managing personal finances, and understanding a host of other problems facing the human race over the next century, which Professor Bartlett elaborates on.</p>

<p>Well worth the time to watch it.</p>

Fortunately, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822052443/http://www.programmingbooks.org/">archive.org preserved it</a>, and the owner intends to get it <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2779740/what-happened-to-programming-books-com">back online sometime soon.</a></p>

<p>Any kind of technical book generally takes longer to read than other books, since you not only have to work through the problem sets to understand the material, but also reread most of it multiple times, either as part of a <a href="http://www.ewrd.com/ewrd/index.asp">speed-reading method</a> or as you review the material while working on the problems.</p>

<p>A site like this one is invaluable in cutting down the time required to find the books most highly regarded among professional programmers, software engineers, and hackers. Additionally, less noise (marginal and non-programming books) than Amazon and more trustworthy reviews provide an essentially industry-certified curriculum that&#8217;s better than what some schools offer (the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=diploma%20factory">diploma factories</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploma_mill">mills</a>, at least).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just reposting a <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1747713">little gem from HackerNews</a>&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li><p>Be good. Be very good. Don&#8217;t be the &#8220;front-end guy&#8221; or the &#8220;back-end guy&#8221;, or some other &#8220;guy&#8221;. Once you know what you want to build, building software is about five things: algorithms that solve your problem, programming languages that express your algorithms, computer architecture that makes your algorithms run efficiently on real hardware, the practical toolchain, and the management of complexity of real software. So study algorithms, and then graduate algorithms, and then advanced graduate algorithms. Do every challenge problem online. Study programming languages to express those algorithms. You can get away with three: C, Lisp, Haskell. Everything else is crud. Study computer architecture and compilers to see how your programs run efficiently. Learn great tools (Emacs/Vim/Visual Studio/bash/Linux/OS X/Windows whatever - just great ones that you&#8217;re damn good at). Learn how complexity is managed. Look at lare open source projects, study how they&#8217;re organized, and contribute patches to understand how small changes can effect a large system.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn what to build. Once you get really good, your time starts to be more valuable than gold. There will be very few people in the world who are as good (the internet will bias you to think that the world is full of great people - this ain&#8217;t so, there isn&#8217;t enough of &#8216;em). You owe it to people and to yourself not to bother with improving something by 1% or 10% because you&#8217;re wasting time in opportunity cost and could be improving something by 1000%. Make sure what you&#8217;re building is worth building, and make sure every line of code you write is worth writing, otherwise you will fail. Break the NIH syndrome in yourselves now (all good people have it, phenomenal people that build successful companies broke it in themselves). Learn to infer what people want.</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#8217;re that good, you will easily get a $100k job after graduation (probably more by then), and grow to $180k in a few years. That&#8217;s very, very comfortable. It&#8217;s not worth busting your ass 16 hours a day to build another CRM tool when you can have a $180k job. So don&#8217;t start a business to start a business. Start a business to bring a meaningful change in the world. A huge change. A 1000% change. There are lots of hugely successful companies out there that do what&#8217;s not meaningful to you - ignore them. But do make sure that what&#8217;s meaningful to you is also meaningful to millions (hopefully billions) of others. You won&#8217;t get rich writing Lisp compilers.</p></li>

<p>  This is what matters. Most everything else is fluff.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+use+lisp+with+vim">web is replete</a> with people trying to create, or learn, an efficient workflow for programming Lisp in Vim.  I&#8217;m the latter.  A vim amateur/intermediate, a Lisp noob.<br/>
I want a quick and easy way to hack Lisp in Vim, save it in a file, load it into the REPL, hack some more in the REPL, and push the file to Github, without having to take the time to learn Emacs and <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a>, or even <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2531">SLIMV</a> (I&#8217;ll get around to these later after I&#8217;ve learned the language somewhat).</p>

<p>My solution:  two terminal windows (three if you want one for vcs commits).  One with vim and your code, the second with a REPL, the third with command prompt in your working/project directory for git commits.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In vim, make your changes and save :w.  Leave the editor open.</p></li>
<li><p>Alt-tab to the REPL terminal, use (load &#8216;filename.lisp) to reload your code after changing it.</p></li>
<li><p>In the third terminal, add, commit, and push to vcs as necessary.</p></li>
</ol>
